    <div class="title" href= "Why_Travel">Why do we Travel?</div>
    <div class="paragraph"> When Christopher Columbus and his men landed in what is today the Dominican Republic, they asked themselves whether they had sunken into the ocean and died somewhere along the journey, because the beaches and rainforest of the island were so gorgeous that Columbus thought they had gone to Heaven.
  Even though Columbus did not reach a heavenly paradise upon landing, for the Europeans back home, the news of a newly found world, later to be called the “Americas”, became a mysterious dream.
  New people started to travel in order to discover uncharted parts of the new world, while the Europeans who remained home read about their amazing experiences. They read about vast tropical lands, exotic yet delicious foods, accounts of magical creatures that had never been seen before, and people of a different race who were called cannibals, witches, or gentle folks. It is no surprise that Europeans of the Renaissance would have seen the rest of the world as a magical place, not only for the opportunity to become rich, but for the mysteries yet to be uncovered.
  For most Europeans of the Renaissance, travelling to a different country was only an impossible dream or fantasy.  In our modern age however, these experiences could cost us a plane ticket as low as 20 euros.
   There is no other time in history where we could take our families from the cold and wet marshes of England to the warm and sandy beaches of Costa Rica, Thailand, Florida and many more places, within less than 24 hours.

  Yet the question remains, why do we actually travel?

  For Christopher Colombus and the people of the Renaissance it is clear that they wanted to explore the mystery and great wealth that the newly discovered world had to offer.
  But in our time, we have discovered every new land on this earth, so why do we continue to travel?
  Ask anyone of your friends who travel for pleasure why they travel, and you will hear answers like these: “So that I can relax...”, “To get a change of scenery…”, “To try and discover new things…” and so on.

  These are very basic answers to a gigantic question. A question that I believe two people of the Renaissance had already explored before us: Richard Hakluyt and William Shakespeare. <p> </div>
